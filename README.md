# Curated Metadata and Digital Humanities: Using JSON Exports to Reimagine Data Access for Online Catalogs in vHMML
The Hill Museum & Manuscript Library has developed a new method that allows scholars to easily curate metadata from HMML's online catalog, vHMML Reading Room. Selected metadata can be exported as JSON for scholars to use in a variety of formats suitable for building unique digital humanities projects based on metadata needs. The presentation will discuss and demonstrate the implementation of vHMML's Data Portal, the underlying technical aspects of harvesting and exporting the metadata from the database, and how the data portal reimagines the online catalog as a research technology for scholars.
